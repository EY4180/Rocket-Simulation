# ENSC2001 Rocket Simulation
## Introduction
This was just a small project I used to learn how to use/manipulate forms in pascal. The feature-set is quite small and it probably isnt as efficient as I'd hoped.

I was mainly inspired to do the project because of a assignment I got which didnt sit right with me. I just couldnt get it off my mind for a long time, so here it is. Im done with this and if you care to use it, by all means do so.

## How To Use
Just download the .exe and the fonts folder. By putting them in the same directory you can execute the program just fine. Without the fonts folder you will have troubles generating any reports. If you want to use the .exe on a mac I've tested it with wine64 and it runs fine but the dpi-scaling might be a bit wonky. If lazarus ever becomes supported again on the macOS then I'll compile a mac-version. 

## To Do List
This is still under construction. Things that need to be done are
- Comment the code
- Error checking on user input
- Error checking on edge cases (e.g. Water volume less than bottle capacity)
